    "# Chapter 2: Risk Metrics #\n",
    "&copy; 2019 Kenneth Winston\n",
    "\n",
    "If risk is _lack of information about the future_, and measurement is _the act of determining a quantity with precision_, then the phrase **`risk measurement`** is at war with itself. It is only possible to measure [Knightian risk](#knightian_risk), where all the outcomes and all their probabilities are known [a priori](#knight_a_priori). Thus a casino can <u>measure</u> the risk that a lucky bettor will win a million dollars at roulette.\n",
    "\n",
    "But real-world economic activity cannot be fully described by [Knightian risk](#knightian_risk), so risk in financial markets cannot really be measured. It can only be <u>estimated</u>. At best, there might be extensive empirical experience with a relevant quantity, along with a strong rational basis for certain kinds of behaviors, that allow the analyst to estimate risk with a high degree of confidence. At worst, a situation might fall into the abyss of Knight's lowest category where \"there is no valid basis of any kind\" to classify risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimating **`risk metrics`** is a worthwhile activity: it imparts discipline and transparency to the process of analyzing risk. Discipline and transparency in turn allow the metrics, and the process of estimating them, to improve over time. However, the usual caution applies: false precision needs to be counterbalanced by common sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the oldest risk metrics is volatility: the more a quantity varies, the less sure we are about its future. We will discuss this metric here and in Chapter 4. We'll also discuss Value at Risk, a metric widely used by some financial market participants, along with related metrics. We'll discuss coherent risk measures, also intended for use by financial market participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then discuss pricing kernels, also known as stochastic discount factors and intertemporal marginal rates of substitution. Pricing kernels are not widely used by financial market participants, but are a central paradigm for economists. We'll discuss some recent work that has improved the testability of stochastic discount factor theory, possibly positioning the theory for wider use by practitioners."

    "## 2.1 Caveat Laws\n",
    "<a name=\"caveat_laws\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many commentators have captured the problem with the phrase _risk measurement_, or indeed any \"measurement\" of economic or financial parameters: when patterns begin to emerge in measurements made of markets and economies, the participants in those markets and economies see the patterns and change their behaviors, changing the patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "An early version of this sentiment is **`Goodhart's Law`**, named after British economist Charles Goodhart's statement in 1974:\n",
    ">Any statistical relationship will break down when used for policy purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goodhart was talking about Frank Knight's second category of risk &mdash; [statistical probability](#knight_statistical_probability) &mdash; in the context of public policy targets set by the [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/about/history), the central bank of the United Kingdom. As soon as economic actors know that there is a target, they will alter their behavior so that (for example) events that only happened 1% of the time in the past now happen more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goodhart's Law was extended by [J&oacute;n Dan&iacute;elsson in 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-4266(02)00263-7) to say\n",
    ">A risk model breaks down when used for its intended purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dan&iacute;elsson pointed out that some people assume in error that\n",
    ">...the role of the risk forecaster is akin to a meteorologists job, who can forecast the weather, but not influence it. [But] if risk measurements influence people's behavior, it is inappropriate to assume market prices follow an independent stochastic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, most economists are keenly aware of the [Nobel Laureate Robert Lucas's](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1995/lucas/biographical) version of the idea, called the **`Lucas Critique`**[$^1$](#two_footnotes). Lucas claimed that econometric models &mdash; essentially Knight's [statistical probability](#knight_statistical_probability) &mdash; can be used only for short-term forecasting and not to make economic policy decisions because\n",
    ">...the features which lead to success in short-term forecasting are unrelated to quantitative policy evaluation, that the major econometric models are (well) designed to perform the former task only, and that simulations using these models can, in principle, provide <u>no</u> useful information as to the actual consequences of alternative economic policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to continue Dan&iacute;elsson's meteorolgist analogy, Lucas says that examining past economic patterns may help to predict the weather for the short term, but it doesn't tell you how to change the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "These cautionary statements are daunting; if nothing works, then why bother? An answer can be obtained by thinking about these two statements:\n",
    "1. All humans are giraffes, except the ones who aren't.\n",
    "2. All humans have five fingers on each hand, except the ones who don't.\n",
    "<a name=\"five_fingers\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Both statements are true, but the first one is only vacuously true: everyone falls into the exception category. But as an approximation to human fingerness, five is pretty good: there aren't that many exceptions. For many practical purposes &mdash; for example, for a glove manufacturer setting up a mold for his glove-making machine &mdash; it suffices to say that humans have five fingers on each hand. However if someone were to bet a billion dollars that every human has five fingers on each hand, [hyperdactyl people](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44312666/ns/health-mens_health/t/man-calls-his-fingers-toes-blessing) would arrive to collect:\n",
    "![](six_fingers.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, the rendering of this common theme might be:\n",
    ">All laws in mathematical finance have counterexamples, except this one. Mathematical finance should be made as rigorous as possible, but no more rigorous.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematics of finance and economics can be beautiful and deep, and resulting metrics can be appealingly precise, but they are not really binding as they would be in mathematics or physics. There are always exceptions, some of them engendered by the very act of stating the \"theorem\" or \"law.\" A liberal application of common sense is needed to see whether or not we are inadvertently encouraging searches for hyperdactyly. But if results and metrics are seen as guides to intuition rather than irrevocable laws, they can be quite useful."

    "## 2.2 Volatility ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuroscientists using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have found that human (and other species, such as macaque monkey) brains seem to have built-in systems to monitor and update volatility estimates. Peter Bossaerts summarized the state of the art as of [December 2018](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnint.2018.00061):\n",
    ">Learning signals that have been identified in neural activation within aIns [anterior insula] appear to be related to risk and surprise. That is, neural signals correlate with the size of prediction errors (PEs), i.e., the un-signed PE (it is always non-negative) (Fouragnan et al., [2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-04507-w), [2018](https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24047)). aIns neural signals encode the anticipated size of upcoming PEs, which means that they track risk. When uncertainty materializes, aIns neural signals encode surprise, i.e., the extent to which the size of the PE is greater or less than anticipated (Preuschoff et al., [2008](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4286-07.2008)).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Behrens et. al. in 2007](https://doi.org/10.1038/nn1954) did experiments using a game where subjects needed to estimate both averages and volatilities to do better. They found\n",
    ">...that human subjects assess volatility in an optimal manner and adjust decision-making accordingly. This optimal estimate of volatility is reflected in the fMRI signal in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) when each trial outcome is observed. When a new piece of information is witnessed, activity levels reflect its salience for predicting future outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We [noted](#central_moments) that the word \"volatility\" usually means standard deviation\n",
    "$$\\sigma=\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}\\bigl[\\bigl(x-\\mathbb{E}[x]\\bigr)^2\\bigr]}$$\n",
    "This is a natural number to quantify _lack of information about the future_; the bigger the standard deviation of (say) changes in a value, the bigger the chance that the future value will be far away from the present value (plus the average change). A related quantity that is used in some of the neuroscience investigations is **`mean absolute deviation`**, i.e.\n",
    "$$MAD=\\mathbb{E}\\bigl[\\bigl|x-\\mathbb{E}[x]\\bigr|\\bigr]\\label{eq:mean_absolute_deviation}\\tag{2.1}$$\n",
    "For a normal distribution, $MAD=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\sigma$. For other distributions, standard deviation gives more weight to outliers than MAD.\n",
    "\n",
    "fMRI tests are not needed to demonstrate the instinctive assessment of volatility; you can immediately see it. Consider the two time series randomly generated in Figure 2.1. The horizontal axis is time, and the vertical axis represents the time-varying value of an original dollar invested at time zero:"

    "Here we have used standard deviation for volatility; the blue time series in Figure 2.1 was generated with 30 times the standard deviation of the orange time series. They have been forced to end up in the same place - the starting dollar at time period 0 grows to \\\\$1.22 at time period 1. But if you were asked to predict where each time series would be at future time period 2, you would instinctively have much more confidence predicting that the low-volatility orange time series would continue to grow at about the same pace between period 1 and period 2 as it did between period 0 and period 1. It would be very difficult to make any prediction about where the blue series would be at time period 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes **`downside semi-variance`** or its square root, **`downside semi-standard-deviation`** is used:\n",
    "$$\\sigma_{down}^2=\\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\mu}(x-\\mu)^2\\cdot dF(x)}{F(\\mu)}\\label{eq:downside_semi}\\tag{2.2}$$\n",
    "Here $\\mu$ is the mean of the distribution. Some writers have favored $\\sigma_{down}$ on the basis of a supposed indifference to \"upside risk.\" If risk is [peril](#peril_vs_venture) then this might make sense: we'd mainly be focused on the bad outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However if risk is [venture](#peril_vs_venture), then the justification for using $\\sigma_{down}$ is less obvious. For example, consider the following two distributions, each with the four equally likely outcomes shown:\n",
    "- Distribution A: -5%, -2%, 2%, 5%<br>\n",
    "- Distribution B: -5%, -2%, 0.1%, 6.9%<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "These both average zero and have the same downside semi-variance. Distribution B has a higher overall variance, reflecting the bigger range of upside possibilities. If we care about the upside &mdash; which we do when we are engaged in venture risk management rather than peril risk management &mdash; the overall variance is more informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some practitioners use **`interquartile range`** as a risk measure. If $F$ is a cdf, then its interquartile range is\n",
    "$$IQR(F)=F^{-1}(.75)-F^{-1}(.25)$$\n",
    "More generally, the **`inter-p-tile range`** is\n",
    "$$IR(p,F)=F^{-1}(1-p)-F^{-1}(p)\\label{eq:interptile_range}\\tag{2.3}$$\n",
    "Ranges fit nicely with the intuition of risk as lack of information about the future, because smaller ranges mean we know more and bigger ranges mean we know less. For example the interdecile range $IR(.1,F)$ gives the length of the 80% confidence interval about the median. Ranges are also easy to compute for both empirical and theoretical distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately probability distributions can be arbitrarily complex so compressing all the information in the cdf $F(x)$ into a single number is not going to work. We can try to optimize the amount of information we get from a single scalar metric &mdash; some are better than others depending on the context &mdash; but ultimately multiple metrics are needed."

    "A natural question to ask when making a risky investment is: how bad can things get?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this question is that there's no limit to the range of possibilities. Whatever terrible situation we can imagine can usually be one-upped by an even more terrible one. At some point we descend into absurdity, speculating perhaps that evil aliens with hopelessly superior technology land on Earth and destroy all human life. While this morbid scenario is not utterly impossible, it's highly unrealistic to the point where there's nothing we could or should do about it. Such extreme speculation is not a guide to actions we should take now.\n",

    "VaR is simply a percentile of a probability distribution of wealth[$^3$](#two_footnotes). Let $F_t(w)$ be the cumulative distribution function for the wealth of an institution or portfolio at some time $t$ years in the future. ($t$ might be denominated in other time units like days and is often left implicit.) For a probability $0\\leq p\\leq 1$, we find the amount of wealth $w_p$ so that $F_t(w_p)=1-p$. $w_p$ is called the _$t$-year $p$-Value at Risk_.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a bank wants to estimate how bad things can get in its trading operations, the random variable of interest might be $w$, the net value of its trading capital at the end of tomorrow's trading day. The 99% one-day VaR for its trading operations would be the level that $w$ was expected to exceed, 99 days out of 100. So if the 99% one-day VaR is \\\\$100,000,000, $w$ is expected to be no less than \\\\$100,000,000 on 99 out of 100 trading days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a problem with VaR: suppose a trader at the \\\\$100,000,000 99% one-day VaR bank has established a strategy where every day, she sells \\\\$100,000 worth of options that have only a 1-in-200 chance of paying off. If the options don't pay off the bank will keep the \\\\$100,000, but if they do pay off, the bank will owe \\\\$1,000,000,000. The 99% VaR calculation does not \"see\" the 99.5% quantile where the options strategy pays off (i.e. loses); it only sees the \\\\$100,000 profits and deems the trade riskless. But the chance that the bank owes a billion dollars is $1-.995^n$ where $n$ is the number of days the strategy is employed; in about six months, there will be a greater-than-50% chance that the bank will owe a billion dollars, possibly wiping out its trading capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "By drawing a line at 99%, the bank actually encouraged behavior just on the other side of the 99% threshold. This is an example of the caveat laws we saw above. Our example bank tried to define \"how bad can things get _realistically_\" to exclude far-fetched scenarios like alien invasions. But as soon as that definition was in place, economic actors were encouraged to engage in behavior that was now deemed far-fetched but that wasn't actually at alien invasion levels of absurdity. We will see that there are better measures than VaR, but any measure is subject to gaming. Further, if more market participants engage in strategies that are just on the other side of the line, their aggregate behavior changes the probabilities so their strategies might no longer be just on the other side of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more formal definition of Value at Risk (VaR) is:\n",
    "$$VaR(p)=\\inf\\{x\\mid Pr(-X\\le x)\\ge p\\}\\label{eq:vardef}\\tag{2.4}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ is the random variable of interest giving future P&L or rate of return. If the random variable of interest is $W$, an absolute amount of wealth, let $X=W-W_0$ where $W_0$ is starting wealth and let $VaR_W(p)=VaR_X(p)+W_0$, where $VaR_X(p)$ is as defined in $\\eqref{eq:vardef}$. If $X$ is in P&L terms, then $–X$ is the distribution of losses, where a bigger number means a bigger loss. The definition says we find the smallest loss $x$ that is greater than or equal to a fraction $p$ of losses. If $X$ has a differentiable cumulative distribution function $F$, then we can write\n",
    "$$VaR(p)=-F^{-1}(1-p);\\hspace{2em}VaR(p)=x \\iff \\int_{-\\infty}^{-x}f(y)dy=1-p\\tag{2.5}$$\n",
    "where f(y) is the probability density function of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Acerbi and Tausche 2002](http://www.bis.org/bcbs/ca/acertasc.pdf) defined **`Expected Shortfall`** as an average of the “bad” VaRs:\n",
    "$$ES(p)=\\frac{1}{1-p}\\int_p^1{VaR(z)dz}\\label{eq:esdef}\\tag{2.6}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is a differentiable cdf $F$, then we can use the [Rockafellar and Uryasev 2000](https://www.risk.net/journal-risk/2161159/optimization-conditional-value-risk) definition of **`cVaR, or conditional Value at Risk`**. It is the expected value given that you are in the VaR tail:\n",
    "$$cVaR(p)=\\frac{-1}{1-p}\\int_{-\\infty}^{-VaR(p)}{yf(y)dy}\\label{eq:cvardef}\\tag{2.7}$$\n",
    "Note that when there is a differentiable cdf $F$, the change of variable $1-z=F(y)$ in the definition of $ES(p)$ makes it equivalent to $cVaR(p)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\frac{1}{1-p}$ factor on the right of \\eqref{eq:esdef} and \\eqref{eq:cvardef} normalizes the probability density functions so they integrate to one in the tail. For ES, the pdf is uniform, while for cVaR the pdf is the pdf of the random variable X.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Acerbi 2002](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-4266(02)00281-9) defined a family of extensions to expected shortfall he called **`spectral measures of risk.`** Let $w(x)$ be an increasing weight function whose domain is the interval $[0,1]$ and whose range is the positive real numbers. So $w^{\\prime}(x)\\geq0$ and $\\int_0^1 w(x)dx=1$. Then the spectral measure based on $w$ is\n",
    "$$SRM(w)=\\int_0^1 VaR(x)w(x)dx\\label{eq:spectral}\\tag{2.8}$$\n",
    "When $w(x)=0$ for $x\\lt p$ and $w(x)=\\frac{1}{1-p}$ for $x\\geq p$, $SRM(w)=ES(p)$. Spectral measures outside of expected shortfall are not widely used at this writing. They might come into play when a transition to the risk-critical area is desired to be less jumpy than expected shortfall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2.2 generates 1000 random numbers and computes the sample 99% VaR &mdash; the number at the $1^{st}$ percentile of the distribution. A useful convention when analyzing sample distributions consisting of $n$ points is to assume that the $i^{th}$ point is the $\\frac{i}{n+1}$ percentile of the distribution, thereby allowing for more extreme values at either end than the ones that have been observed so far. So the first percentile of the 1000 numbers is a little bigger than the $10^{th}$ smallest observation (i.e. the loss is a little less). The code also computes the average of the observations that are less than 99% VaR and displays that average (red line) as cVaR:"

    "<a name=\"coherent_risk\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the late 1990s, four co-authors [Artzner, Delbaen, Eber and Heath (\"ADEH\")](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~delbaen/ftp/preprints/CoherentMF.pdf) postulated a series of mathematical axioms that, they claimed, any reasonable (\"coherent\") measure of financial risk should have. They were trying to avoid damaging situations like the trader's option strategy described in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADEH's definition of risk is more accounting-oriented than the essentially probabilistic Knight definitions. For ADEH, risk is how much cash has to be put into a portfolio to make it acceptable. An \"acceptable\" portfolio is one that passes regulatory or other hurdles. So to ADEH, risk is a peril &mdash; the chance of having an unacceptable portfolio &mdash; and the metric for risk is the size of the monetary fortification you need to build to protect yourself from the peril.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if your portfolio contains the previous section's options trading strategy, losing a billion dollars would probably be unacceptable. Maybe \"acceptable\" means never having less than \\\\$100,000,000. If you added \\\\$1,100,000,000 in cash to that portfolio, you'd eliminate the possibility of ending up below the threshhold, making the portfolio (or at least that part of the portfolio) acceptable. The ADEH-type risk of the options trade might then be \\\\$1.1 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, ADEH defined a **`risk measure`** as a mapping from a random variable $X$ to the real numbers. $X$ could be an amount of money; a change in an amount of money; or a rate of return. The sample space $\\Omega$ (which ADEH assume is finite) encompasses all relevant economic conditions one period forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"risk_free_instrument\"></a>ADEH assumed there is a single risk-free instrument $R_f$, sometimes called a **`money market account`** or just **`cash`**. $R_f$ is an investment that will always be worth one unit of currency one period in the future, no matter what state the world is in at that time. In practice $R_f$ is a loan to a completely reliable institution like a very solid government or bank. We'll learn more about the time value of money in Chapter 3, but for now note that money in the future is not the same as money now, so $R_f$ is not necessarily worth one unit of currency now. If the completely reliable institution is paying a rate of interest $r_f$ per period, $R_f$ will be worth $\\frac{1}{1+r_f}$ now.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADEH put forward four axioms that sensible risk measures $\\rho$ must satisfy.\n",
    "- Axiom T (**Translation Invariance**):\n",
    "$\\rho(X+\\alpha R_f)=\\rho(X)-\\alpha$. This says we can decrease our risk by adding cash to our portfolio. ADEH point out that this means $\\rho(X+\\rho(X)R_f)=0$, i.e. $\\rho(X)$ is the amount of cash that will eliminate risk.\n",
    "- Axiom S (**Subadditivity**):\n",
    "$\\rho(X+Y)\\leq\\rho(X)+\\rho(Y)$. This says diversification helps, or at least doesn’t hurt, to reduce risk. ADEH note that if this were not true, entities (trading desks, banks, companies, portfolios) would be encouraged to split up into pieces to give the appearance of having less risk. \n",
    "- Axiom PH (**Positive Homogeneity**):\n",
    "If $\\lambda\\geq0$, then $\\rho(\\lambda X)=\\lambda\\rho(X)$. We know from Axiom S that $\\rho(nX)\\leq n\\rho(X)$. This says that equality holds, and fills in between the integers. In effect this ignores liquidity risk[$^4$](#two_footnotes), which ADEH acknowledge; they are focused on whether an amount of money is sufficient or not.\n",
    "- Axiom M (**Monotonicity**): \n",
    "If $X\\leq Y$, then $\\rho(Y)\\leq \\rho(X)$. Here $X\\leq Y$ means that the random variable $Y$ stochastically[$^5$](#two_footnotes) dominates the [random variable](#basic_probability_terminology) $X$. So this axiom says that having more money is less risky than having less money.\n",
    "\n",
    "A risk measure satisfying these four axioms is called **`coherent`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see whether you've understood coherent risk, see if you can resolve the following puzzle:\n",
    ">Suppose $X$ is a random variable that gives us more money than we have now under any circumstances; say $X(0)=0$ where 0 is the current time, and $X(1)=2$ or $X(1)=4$ with equal probability at time 1 in the future. Let $Y=2X$. Axiom PH says $\\rho(Y)=2\\rho(X)$. But Axiom M says $\\rho(Y)\\leq \\rho(X)$. How can both statements be true?\n",
    "\n",
    "The axioms of subadditivity and positive homogeneity are sometimes replaced by a single, weaker axiom:\n",
    "- Axiom C (**Convexity**)\n",
    "If $1\\geq \\lambda\\geq 0$, then $\\rho(\\lambda X+(1-\\lambda)Y)\\leq\\lambda\\rho(X)+(1-\\lambda)\\rho(Y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A risk measure satisfying translation invariance, convexity, and monotonicity is called a **`convex risk measure`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen an unfortunate failing of the VaR measure - it fails to detect rare but disastrous events that are below the probability threshhold. But ADEH give another example that shows that VaR isn't convex, so it certainly isn't coherent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have two digital options on a stock. The first one, A, costs h at time 0 and pays 1000 at time 1 if the value of the stock is over some H, and 0 otherwise. The second digital option, B, costs l (lower case L) at time 0 and pays 1000 at time 1 if the value of the stock is under some L, and 0 otherwise. Here $L<H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The payoff profile of buying both A and B: you get 1000 if the stock ends up under L or over H, and nothing in between. Suppose we choose L and H so that $Pr(Stock<L)=Pr(Stock>H)=80bps$. A is a lottery ticket that pays off 1000 less than 1% of the time, and zero the rest of the time. Its expected value is 8, and any risk-averse utility function is going to value it less than 8. Even a risk-loving but reasonable utility function will value it closer to 8 than to 1000. Similarly for option B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume without loss of generality that the risk-free instrument $R_f$ is worth 1 today (i.e. the risk-free rate 0), then there is no time value of money to worry about and the 99% money VaR of writing (going short) 2 A’s is -2h, because 99.2% of the time the option does not pay off and you pocket 2h from writing the options. Having positive money is negative value at risk. Similarly the 99% money VaR of writing 2 B’s is -2l.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, suppose you write one A and one B. The middle ground between L and H – the place where neither pays off – has $100\\%-.8\\%-.8\\%=98.4\\%$ probability. There is a $1.6\\%$ chance the stock will end up either very low (less than L, where B pays off) or very high (greater than H, where A pays off). The 99% money VaR of writing one A and one B is 1000-l-h, a (large) positive number.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this is another example of VaR not seeing concentrated risk. One A and one B is a better-diversified portfolio than two A’s. In effect the VaR measure encourages its users to double up on their low-probability bets (or triple up or quadruple up…). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can’t hide problems in the tail with expected shortfall/cVaR/spectral risk measures – they get averaged in. ES/cVaR/SRM do the right thing in the digital options example. [Acerbi 2002](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0378-4266(02)00281-9)) showed that spectral risk measures are coherent, so expected shortfall (and therefore cVaR when there is a differentiable cdf F) are also coherent. In January 2011 (about 13 years after ADEH), the [Basel Committee on Banking Supervision](http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs_wp19.pdf) noted\n",
    ">VaR has become a standard risk measure in finance. Notwithstanding its widespread use, it has been criticised in the literature for lacking subadditivity... The most popular alternative to VaR is expected shortfall, which is subadditive. It is slowly gaining popularity among financial risk managers.\n",

    "The maximum share price on each isoprobability curve in Figure 2.3 is $p$, the probability of success. But the price $q$ that investors are willing to pay drops as the fraction of wealth at risk gets higher and higher, because investors demand a premium to take the risk. Eventually with log-utility they just won't pay anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different potential investors will have different levels of starting wealth, so their places on the X-axis of Figure 2.3 will vary. In practice no one has definitive knowledge of the probability of success $p$, so different investors will have different ideas about where to be on the Y-axis of Figure 2.3. In fact some or all potential investors may not even have log-utility functions. In fact they may [not even act as if they have utility functions](#utility_drawbacks).\n",
    "\n",
    "All these complications are rather discouraging. Nonetheless, securities do manage to trade. Market participants come to a price they would be willing to pay (if they are potential buyers) or receive (if they are potential sellers) based on their combined thoughts about probability of success and risk preference. If the highest-price buyer has a price that is above or equal to the lowest-price seller, then a transaction will take place at a _market-clearing price $q$_ that matches up overlapping buyers and sellers. These buyers and sellers are cleared from the market since their wishes are fulfilled."

    "## 2.6 No-Arbitrage ##\n",
    "<a name=\"no_arbitrage\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use \"W\" (for \"win\") to denote a share of MiDCo; W's price is $q$. And suppose that there exists a complementary security \"L\" (for \"lose\") that pays \\\\$1 if the multiple integration drug fails, and \\\\$0 if it succeeds. If I buy one W and one L, the combined position of the two securities will be worth \\\\$1 one year from now no matter what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "While W alone or L alone are risky securities - we don't know at the present time whether they will pay off or not - the combination W+L is risk-free. We know exactly what will happen to W+L in the future: no matter which outcome is realized, W+L will be worth \\\\$1. That's the same as the [risk-free instrument](#risk_free_instrument) $R_f$. If the value of $W+L$ today is less than the value of $R_f$ today, then we would buy $W+L$ and sell $R_f$ (the equivalent of borrowing money). That would net a positive amount $W+L-R_f$ today and always be worth nothing in the future, so we would be able to pocket free money by doing this. If the value of $W+L$ today is greater that the value of $R_f$ today, we'd reverse signs on the transaction and pocket free money.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental principle in markets is that there shouldn't be opportunities to make free money. If an investor can take on a position that costs nothing, and its value in at least one future state of the world is strictly positive while its value in no future state of the world is negative (i.e. the investor never owes money), then that's free money. Or equivalently, if taking on a position has a strictly negative cost (i.e. taking on the position gives money to the investor in the present time) while in all future states of the world the position's value is non-negative, then that's free money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a free money position is called a **`(risk-free) arbitrage`**, and the assumed lack of such opportunities is called **`no-arbitrage`**. There can actually be risk in a risk-free arbitrage; there can be uncertainty about exactly how much free money the arbitrage will produce. A risk-free arbitrage is actually a **`peril-free arbitrage`**; there is no danger of losing money. But the \"risk-free\" label is universally used.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"law_of_one_price\"></a>A slightly narrower version of the no-arbitrage idea is the **`Law of One Price,`** which says that the same item can't have two different prices in two different markets at the same time. If it did, an abritrageur could buy the item where it is cheaper and sell it where it is dearer, creating a riskless arbitrage. In theory, for example, the price of gold in New York and the price of gold in London should be the same at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice arbitrages can and do exist. They can appear momentarily, for example due to mistakes by market participants. But vigilant investors will quickly see such mistakes and take advantage of them. The very act of taking advantage of arbitrages will eventually make them disappear, since the arbitrageur will exert pressure on prices in the right direction by buying too-cheap securities and selling too-expensive securities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible for small arbitrages to exist because there may be costs involved in taking advantage of the arbitrage. For example, if the price of gold in New York is less than the price of gold in London, then the Law of One Price implies that an arbitrageur could buy gold in New York and sell it in London. But as a practical matter gold dealers would charge a commission for the buy in New York and the sale in London, and it would cost something to transport the gold from New York to London. Further, the transportation would take a little time during which the price could change. There might be taxes in one or both locations. There might be regulatory restrictions on importing or exporting gold.\n",
    "\n",
    "There might be **`execution risk`** - a dealer who said it would deliver gold to you goes bankrupt, for example, and fails to deliver. If that happens before you pay the dealer it's still a problem, because you've promised gold to another dealer and now have to get it somewhere else, possibly at a higher price. If the delivering dealer goes bankrupt after you've paid but before delivering, it's even worse (**`counterparty risk`**).\n",
    "\n",
    "More subtley, taking advantage of an arbitrage requires the temporary use of money that can be needed elsewhere, especially during market disruptions when arbitrages are most apparent. The various impediments to pure theoretical arbitrage are collectively known as [Limits of Arbitrage](https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2329555).\n",
    "\n",
    "So the New York gold price might be a little different than the London gold price and it wouldn't be worth the cost of closing the gap. But if there's a big enough price difference someone will arbitrage it away, or at least down.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general mathematical formulation of the no-arbitrage principle is the following: For any linear combination $a_1x_1+…+a_nx_n$ of securities $x_1,...,x_n$ where the current price of the combination is zero, then either (a) the price of the combination must be zero in all future states of the world; or (b) there must be at least one future state with a strictly positive price and at least one future state with a strictly negative price."

That means these securities are examples of what economists call **`state-price securities`** or **`Arrow-Debreu contingent claims`**. In financial markets, they are called **`binary (or digital) options`**, such as the ones used in ADEH's example of the problems with VaR regarding [coherent risk](#coherent_risk).

If $Q_0$ is differentiable, then $q_0(x)=Q_0^{\\prime}(x)$ is the state price density function. As in the finite case, an adjustment for the time value of money must be applied to the current functions to make them probability densities and cumulative distribution functions; in continuous situations it is [customary to use the adjustment $exp(r_f)$ rather than $1+r_f$](#discounting).

If all the entries of $Q$ are strictly positive, then the Perron-Frobenius Theorem says that $Q$ has a largest positive eigenvalue, and its associated eigenvector $z$ is stricly positive (or strictly negative, but then $-z$ is then strictly positive). Moreover $z$ is the only strictly positive eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the entries of $Q$ are probabilities, they can't be negative. It is possible for entries of $Q$ to equal zero, in which case things get a little messier, but the basic result holds: figure out $Q$ from observed prices and then compute $Q$'s eigensystem. Find the largest positive real eigenvalue; that has to be the unknown discount factor $\\delta$. The associated all-positive eigenvector equals $D^{-1}u$, so the $i^{th}$ entry of the associated eigenvector is $1/h(\\omega_i)$. There are no other candidates among the eigensystem because none of the other eigenvectors is all positive. Thus by invoking Perron-Frobenius, Ross is able to fill in the $n+1$ unknowns ($\\delta$ and the $h(\\omega)$'s) on the RHS of \\eqref{eq:rrecov_natural}.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solves for an SDF and allows empirical tests of predictions like Hansen-Jagannathan \\eqref{eq:sdf_hansenjagbound} to be performed. Further, trading strategies based on recovered probabilities can be developed. For example, [Audrino, Huitema, and Ludwig 2015](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2433170) use a neural network approach to fill in $Q$ from observed options prices. They then investigate trading strategies based on the Ross-recovered moments of the distribution of S&P 500 returns. They find that such trading strategies perform better than strategies based on the moments of the risk-neutral distribution. Thus this recent work has the potential to move SDF's from the academic world to the practitioner world."
