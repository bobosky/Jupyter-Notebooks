    "# Chapter 4. Equity Modeling #\n",
    "&copy; 2022 Kenneth Winston\n",
    "\n",
    "While the pricing formula \\eqref{eq:generic_pricing} is generic enough to cover just about any financial arrangement, it is most useful for fixed income instruments where the planned cash flows are highly likely. As the times and amounts in \\eqref{eq:generic_pricing} become less and less certain, the value of enumerating possible but not probable cash flows gets lower and lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result equity modelers have taken other approaches that have more dominant random components. <a name=\"bachelier\"></a>In his 1900 PhD thesis at the Sorbonne, [Louis Bachelier](https://books.google.com/books?id=XcZwuHGRxsgC&pg) originated an approach to equity that provides the basis for many current models. His approach was essentially formula \\eqref{eq:sde_percentage_changes}; the key insight was the use of Brownian motion ($d\\beta$ in \\eqref{eq:sde_percentage_changes}) 5 years before Einstein's paper on the subject. For good measure Bachelier covered options pricing, anticipating by over 70 years the [Black-Scholes option pricing formula](https://doi.org/10.1086%2F260062)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bachelier's work was largely forgotten by financial economists until it was rediscovered and promoted by the statistician [Leonard Jimmie Savage](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2240741) in the 1950s. Whether they knew it or not, many economists and financial modelers starting in the 1950s and 1960s were using Bachelier's ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll discuss some of the most common equity models, starting with Harry Markowitz's efficient frontier. (The word \"efficient\" here is used in a different sense than in the EMH.) We'll then briefly review Bayes's Rule, and see how Bayesian adjustments are often used in practical methods to select portfolios with simultaneous risk and reward optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on these ideas, we'll show a practical and widely used Bayesian method for equity expected return estimation, the Black-Litterman algorithm."

    "## 4.1 Markowitz Efficient Frontier\n",
    "<a name=\"markowitz_efficient_frontier\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Harry Markowitz is considered the father of quantitative finance. In a [1952 Journal of Finance article](https://doi.org/10.2307/2975974), he considered the problem of how investors should assemble sets of assets (**`portfolios`**) from individual assets. He expanded on these ideas in his 1954 PhD thesis at the University of Chicago and in a [1959 book](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1bh4c8h).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to Markowitz, investment managers who constructed portfolios had a concept that risk was something you needed to be compensated for bearing. This was compatible with Frank Knight's formulation of risk as lack of information about the future: you needed to be paid to expose your portfolio to an unknown future. However, there was no metric for risk and therefore no precise link between how much risk you took and how much you needed to be compensated for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea that you could put a number on financial risk &mdash; that you could measure your lack of information about the future of an investment &mdash; is essentially due to Markowitz, who won the [1990 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1990/press-release/) for his work. Markowitz is currently an adjunct professor at the [University of California at San Diego](https://rady.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/markowitz/).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of thinking of a portfolio is as an n-vector $w$ (where n is the number of all the assets in the world) that satisfies the **`budget constraint`** $w^{\\intercal}u=1$ (u the unit n-vector of all ones). $w$ is the vector of weights of assets you own at a certain time, scaled so it represents 100% of your wealth. $w$ can contain negative values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **`return`** or **`rate of return`** on an asset during a time period is the ending value of the asset divided by the beginning value of the asset, minus one. If there are distributions such as dividends or coupons during the period, they are added (possibly in a time-adjusted way) to the ending value. The returns on the $n$ assets in the world during a period can be characterized by a random variable $n$-vector $r$. Thus the scalar random variable giving the return of a portfolio $w$ during the period is $w^{\\intercal}r.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Markowitz introduced the idea that investors think of risk as volatility, as measured by the statistic standard deviation (or its square, variance). In our notation, standard deviation $\\sigma$ of a portfolio $w$ is $\\sigma=\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[\\bigl(w^{\\intercal}(r-\\mathbb{E}[r]\\bigr)^2]}=\\sqrt{w^{\\intercal}\\mathbb{E}[(r-\\mathbb{E}[r])(r-\\mathbb{E}[r])^{\\intercal}]w}$. This is sensible and intuitive, as we noted in Chapter 2: there is less information about the future in a high-volatility series than in a low-volatility series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on this intuition, Markowitz's basic formulation was:\n",
    ">Given a choice between two portfolios with the same expected (arithmetic) return, any rational investor will prefer the one with less risk (that is, less variance of returns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalently\n",
    ">Given a choice between two portfolios with the same risk (variance of returns), any rational investor will prefer the one with more arithmetic or expected return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider again the [Generous Billionaires](#generous_billionaires) of Chapter 1. We saw that because of risk aversion, most people would not value a coin toss for $\\$1,000,000,000$ or $\\$0$ at the average $\\$500,000,000$. Put another way, most people would pay far less than $\\$500,000,000$ to purchase a portfolio consisting of one Generous Billionaire tossing a coin for a billion or zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "But suppose that you were able to form a portfolio of 100 coin-tossing [Generous Billionaires](#generous_billionaires), each tossing a different coin and paying $\\$10,000,000$ on heads and nothing on tails. Your best and worst cases are still one billion and zero, as they were with the single coin-tossing [Generous Billionaire](#generous_billionaires). But the chance of your portfolio being worth nothing is now $2^{-100}$, which is effectively zero. The outcomes of your portfolio form a binomial distribution; the chance of you getting less than $\\$310,000,000$ is less than $10^{-4}$. The average value of the portfolio is still $\\$500,000,000$. But by just about any measure, risk has gone down.\n",
    "\n",
    "So by forming a portfolio, you get the same reward as a single coin toss, with less risk. In Markowitz's formulation, the portfolio of 100 coin-tossing billionaires is more _efficient_ than the portfolio of one coin-tossing billionaire. It has the same expected return, and lower standard deviation (\\\\$5 million vs. \\\\$500 million).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not just financial wizardry; **`diversification`** is often a better way to allocate human efforts. Pursuing 100 different ventures may be a better technique for progress than everyone working on one venture, just like it was better for the farmer and the hunter in the [two-person economy](#two_person_economy) to pool their different food-gathering efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markowitz's primary risk metric, standard deviation, fails the ADEH monotonicity criterion discussed in Chapter 2, but is otherwise coherent. Actually the near-coherent risk metric is $\\rho(X)=\\lambda\\sigma(X)-\\mu(X)$, where $\\lambda>0$ is a scalar and $\\sigma(X)$ and $\\mu(X)$ are the standard deviation and mean of $X$. Suppose $R_f$ and $Y$ are random variables that cost the same at present. $R_f$ is the [risk-free instrument](#risk_free_instrument) that will be worth \\\\$1 in all future states, while $Y$ will be worth $\\$1$ half the time and $\\$3$ the other half the time. $\\rho(R_f)=-1$ while $\\rho(Y)=\\lambda-2$, so the statewise dominant $Y$ shows more risk than $R_f$ when $\\lambda$ is large enough. Thus standard deviation can say there is risk in taking advantage of [riskless arbitrages](#no_arbitrage); that's nonsense. Fortunately Markowitz's framework had few of the kinds of instruments &mdash; like derivatives &mdash; that would be the most obvious source of such arbitrage possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have accepted the idea that a rational investor will choose the less risky portfolio from two with the same arithmetic mean return, you can form an **`efficient frontier`**: a set of portfolios that have the least possible risk at a given level of return; or the greatest possible return at a given level of risk. An efficient portfolio is one that achieves equipoise between the increase-return and decrease-risk goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"markowitz_m_vector\"></a>\n",
    "Let $\\boldsymbol{m}=\\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{r}]=(\\mathbb{E}[r_1],\\mathbb{E}[r_2],\\dots\\mathbb{E}[r_n])^{\\intercal}$ be the vector of expected returns from now until one period in the future. Here $r_i$ is the scalar random variable giving returns of the $i^{th}$ asset and $\\mathbb{E}[]$ is the expected value operator. Then $\\mathbb{E}[\\boldsymbol{w^{\\intercal}r}]=\\boldsymbol{m^{\\intercal}w}$. Let\n",

    "$$C=\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\sigma_1^2&\\sigma_{12}&\\dots&\\sigma_{1n}\\\\\n",
    "\\sigma_{21}&\\sigma_2^2&\\dots&\\sigma_{2n}\\\\\n",
    "\\dots\\\\\n",

    "be the covariance matrix of returns, $C=\\mathbb{E}[(r-\\mathbb{E}[r])(r-\\mathbb{E}[r])^{\\intercal}]=\\mathbb{E}[rr^{\\intercal}]-\\mathbb{E}[r]\\mathbb{E}[r]^{\\intercal}$. The $(i,j)$ term looks like $\\sigma_{ij}=\\mathbb{E}[(r_i-\\mathbb{E}[r_i])(r_j-\\mathbb{E}[r_j])]$. Note we sometimes write $\\sigma_i^2$ instead of $\\sigma_{ii}$ for the $i^{th}$ diagonal term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if $\\boldsymbol{w}$ is a portfolio n-vector, $Var[\\boldsymbol{w^{\\intercal}r}]=\\boldsymbol{w^{\\intercal}}C\\boldsymbol{w}$, where Var is the variance (not value-at-risk) operator. If $\\boldsymbol{w}$ is a portfolio on the efficient frontier and $\\boldsymbol{v}$ is another portfolio with $\\boldsymbol{w^{\\intercal}m=v^{\\intercal}m}$ (that is, they have the same expected or arithmetic mean returns), then we must have $Var[\\boldsymbol{v^{\\intercal}r}]\\geq Var[\\boldsymbol{w^{\\intercal}r}]$. Equivalently if $Var[\\boldsymbol{v^{\\intercal}r}]=Var[\\boldsymbol{w^{\\intercal}r}]$ then we must have $\\boldsymbol{w^{\\intercal}m\\geq v^{\\intercal}m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dark blue curve on top of the dots in Figure 4.1 is the efficient frontier &mdash; you can't get any higher than that at a given point on the x axis, nor can you get any further to the left for a given point on the y axis. All the other dots represent inefficient portfolios."

    "Markowitz did not initially think about multiperiod portfolio construction, as that was too hard to deal with in 1952.

Today there are far more such portfolios, but there are also many portfolios that restrict themselves to non-negative holdings.\n",

    "## 4.1.3 Inequality Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Then as $\\lambda_1\\rightarrow\\infty$, efficient portfolios borrow more and more pounds to fund investments in francs and yen, heading off to an infinite expected return. Figure 4.2 stops at $\\lambda_1=1$, but it could keep going.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letting $\\lambda_1$ get arbitrarily large isn't a sensible thing to do. If an investor starts with a dollar, borrows a billion dollars worth of pounds and buys a billion and one dollars of francs&yen, then the slightest disturbance in the relationships between francs, yen and pounds will lead to bankruptcy. Estimated means and covariances can't be treated as certainties, where infinite reliance can be placed on their accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if they were certain, there would be an absorbing barrier problem in the interim. That is, a portfolio can't have a net worth below zero: that's the definition of bankruptcy. **`Positive assets`** like portfolios, companies, stocks, and bonds will stop operating with a value of zero and will not be allowed to take on negative value. It's possible to draw a line on a graph that starts at $\\$1$, meanders down to $-\\$0.10$, and ends up at (positive) $\\$3$. But that line does not represent a real portfolio. That's similar to an absorbing barrier in physics, where a particle can meander only up to the point where it hits the sides of a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to avoid unrealistic negative portfolio values is to constrain all the weights in portfolios on the mean-variance efficient frontier to be non-negative. This changes the problem from one that can be solved in closed form to one that can be solved using a quadratic programming algorithm:\n",
    "$$\\text{Minimize } -\\lambda m^{\\intercal}w + \\frac{1}{2}w^{\\intercal}Cw$$\n",
    "$$\\text{Subject to } w^{\\intercal}u=1 \\text{, each element of } w\\geq0\\label{eq:inequality_frontier}\\tag{4.22}$$\n",
    "In addition to the non-negative constraint, we have restated the problem slightly by building in a parameter $\\lambda$ instead of a target mean $\\mu$. This is the same idea as flipping \\eqref{eq:equal_frontier_lambda_one} to \\eqref{eq:equal_frontier_mu}. When $\\lambda=0$, we solve for the global minimum variance portfolio. As $\\lambda$ increases, we care more and more about return maximization and less and less about variance minimization. Thus $\\lambda$ is a risk tolerance parameter &mdash; something like the [coefficient of absolute risk tolerance](#coeff_abs_risk_tolerance).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\eqref{eq:inequality_frontier} has a quadratic objective function and linear constraints. It's a special case of a more general group of optimizations with convex objective functions and convex constraints. In the next chapter, we'll delve into convex optimization techniques that can be used for efficient solutions of the great matjority of problems likely to arise in portfolio construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to the long-only optimization \\eqref{eq:inequality_frontier} is a piecewise series of solutions to the equality-constrained frontier \\eqref{eq:equal_frontier_mu} and \\eqref{eq:equal_frontier_sigma}. In the Franc/Pound/Yen frontier, for example, the equality-constrained minimum variance portfolio has all positive weights so it is also a solution to \\eqref{eq:inequality_frontier}. The frontiers continue to coincide until the weight on the pound sterling goes to zero. Then the solution to \\eqref{eq:inequality_frontier} is the efficient frontier consisting only of the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen, shown in orange in Figure 4.3 below. Eventually the Swiss franc (the highest-returning single asset) becomes the whole portfolio and the \\eqref{eq:inequality_frontier} long-only frontier stops."

    ">...investors maximizing expected logarithmic utility would hold virtually the same portfolios as investors maximizing certain mean-variance functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly in a 1984 paper, [Kroll, Levy and Markowitz](https://doi.org/10.2307/2327667) concluded\n",
    ">for various utility functions and the historical returns on 3 different sets of securities, when a portfolio may be chosen from any of the infinite number of portfolios of the standard constraint set, the best mean-variance efficient portfolio has almost maximum obtainable expected utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of making the connection between utility functions and the Markowitz efficient frontier objective function is to consider a quadratic one-period risk-averse utility function on returns, i.e. one that looks like $u(z)=-z^2+az$, $a>0$. The coefficient of absolute risk aversion is $2/(a-2z)$ so this is risk-averse when $z<a/2$. That is, $u(z)$ \"likes\" more return for a while, but if the shock is too big (negative or positive), it gets unhappy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The investor wants to maximize the expected utility of returns:\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}[u(r^{\\intercal}w)]=\\mathbb{E}[-(r^{\\intercal}w)^2+a\\cdot r^{\\intercal}w]=-w^{\\intercal}\\mathbb{E}[rr^{\\intercal}]w+aw^{\\intercal}\\mathbb{E}[r]$$\n",
    "where $r$ is the random vector of one-period returns. We have already defined the mean vector $m=\\mathbb{E}[r]$ and the covariance matrix $C=\\mathbb{E}[(r-m)(r-m)^{\\intercal}]$. Thus\n",
    "$$C=\\mathbb{E}[rr^{\\intercal}-2rm^{\\intercal}+mm^{\\intercal}]=E[rr^{\\intercal}]-mm^{\\intercal}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}[u(r^{\\intercal}w)]=-w^{\\intercal}Cw-(w^{\\intercal}m)^2+aw^{\\intercal}m$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to the Markowitz objective function \\eqref{eq:inequality_frontier} (with $a=2\\lambda$ and a change of sign) &mdash; although the covariance matrix is not de-meaned."

    "### 4.1.5 The Capital Market Line\n",
    "\n",
    "The _capital market line_ is derived from the efficient frontier by the addition of a risk-free asset, i.e. a US Treasury or other instrument paying the risk-free rate that we discussed in Chapter 3. We assume the risk-free asset is nonstochastic, so it has no variance and no correlation with anything, including itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look for an efficient frontier in the usual way and just add the risk-free asset to our universe. However this will make our covariance matrix singular. The usual convention is to separate out the risk-free asset, which has a return $r_f$. For example, consider the franc, yen, pound efficient frontier. We zoom in to the beginning of the frontier and add a risk-free asset at (0,.1), i.e. $r_f=.1$bps/day."

    "We can now be more efficient than the (old) efficient frontier. A straight line that runs between the risk-free asset at $(0,r_f)$ and some point $(x,y)$ that is on the efficient frontier where $y\\geq r_f$ will lie above the efficient frontier until $(x,y)$. That line just represents linear combinations of the efficient portfolio at $(x,y)$ and a portfolio consisting only of the risk-free asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact if the tangency point is chosen to be where the line from $(0,r_f)$ to the efficient frontier just touches the top of the frontier, the line will always be above the frontier. That optimal line is the new (including risk-free) efficient frontier and is called the **`capital market line`**. The two-fund separation theorem in formula \\eqref{eq:equal_frontier_two_fund} now becomes even simpler: the new efficient portfolios are linear combinations of the risk-free asset and the tangency portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the capital market line, note that equations \\eqref{eq:equal_frontier_mu} and \\eqref{eq:equal_frontier_sigma} specify the old efficient frontier; \\eqref{eq:equal_frontier_mu} is the y coordinate and \\eqref{eq:equal_frontier_sigma} is the x coordinate. Taking the slope with the chain rule, we see that $\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\frac{x}{\\lambda_1}$. For tangency, this slope must equal $\\frac{y-r_f}{x}$, which is the slope of the line between $(x,y)$ and the risk-free asset's representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving for $\\lambda_1$ gives $\\lambda_1=\\frac{1}{u^{\\intercal}C^{-1}m - r_f(u^{\\intercal}C^{-1}u)}$. Putting this $\\lambda_1$ into \\eqref{eq:equal_frontier_lagrange} gives the tangency portfolio $w_{tp}$:\n",
    "$$w_{tp}=\\frac{C^{-1}(m-r_f u)}{u^{\\intercal}C^{-1}m - r_f(u^{\\intercal}C^{-1}u)}=\\frac{C^{-1}m_e}{u^{\\intercal}C^{-1}m_e}\\label{eq:tangent_portfolio}\\tag{4.30}$$\n",

Note that in the mean/standard deviation graphs we have been drawing, the slope of a line that goes through the point $(0,r_f)$ is the Sharpe ratio of portfolios on that line. Thus the maximum Sharpe ratio efficient portfolio is the tangency portfolio; to see this, visualize the set of lines from $(0,r_f)$ to points on the efficient frontier.\n",

For example, a mutual fund may advertise that it is a \"large-cap US equity fund.\" Investors who favor big US companies can give a sum of money to the mutual fund manager, and the manager will decide which big US companies to buy with that money. The manager would be amiss &mdash; and legally culpable &mdash; if it didn't mostly[$^3$](#four_footnotes) invest its investors' money in big US companies; to do otherwise would be false advertising. By the same token, investors can hardly blame the manager if big US stocks generally do poorly; they knew what they were getting into.\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation is usually handled with a _benchmark portfolio_. Benchmark portfolios are often constructed by institutions that publish transparent benchmark composition rules intended to select certain market segments mechanically. For example, the FTSE/Russell company publishes the [Russell 1000&reg;](https://www.ftse.com/products/indices/russell-us) index of the one thousand largest stocks in Russell's universe; this is widely used as a large-cap US equity benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most benchmark indices are **`capitalization-weighted`**; that is, the holding weights are proportional to the total market values (market price per share time shares outstanding) of the companies in the index. Sometimes caps are put on percentage holdings to attenuate the influence of one dominant player in a market. **`Float-weighting`** is sometimes used when portions of a company are unavailable to the public, for example due to founding family holdings: the \"float\" is the portion of the company that trades freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Equal-weighting`** (or the [1/N rule](#one_over_n)) weighs each of the $N$ securities in an index the same. One argument for this approach notes that if $P_M$ is the market price of a security and $P_T$ is its theoretically correct price if all future information about the company and the economy were known today, then: (a) if $P_M>P_T$, the company is overweighted in capitalization-weighted indices; while (b) if $P_M<P_T$, then the company is underweighted in capitalization-weighted indices. Thus capitalization-weighted indices overweight overpriced securities and underweight underpriced securities. On the other hand equal-weighting is random compared to a company's future prospects and so tends to get about half the weights right and half wrong; $50\\%$ right is better than $0\\%$ right. On the other hand, equal-weighted indices can be impractical if the smaller companies in the index are illiquid.\n",

In our example $b=$[Russell 1000&reg;](https://www.ftse.com/products/indices/russell-us), which itself would be considered to have no risk, while cash would have quite a lot of risk. Rather than $\\sqrt{w^{\\intercal}Cw}$, the relevant volatility would be $\\sqrt{(w-b)^{\\intercal}C(w-b)}$; this benchmark-relative volatility is called _tracking error_.

    "### 4.1.7 Efficient Frontiers: Theory and Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "While Markowitz started the field of quantitative finance and his work was revolutionary, investors quickly found that it often didn't work as well as the qualitative methods they were using before 1952. One problem is that the quadratic optimization process doesn't know that the numbers (means, covariances) it is given can be wrong. While a human would be skeptical about large, too-good-to-be-true returns, the optimization process is likely to put a heavy weight on a security with a too-good-to-be-true return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even realistic returns can lead to unrealistic results. A human would think that the difference between two securities, both with very similar covariances to the rest of the universe, and one with a mean of 1.12345 and the other 1.12346, was random. It wouldn't make much difference if you were buying one or the other. But as we noted when discussing [frontier leverage](#frontier_leverage), if you're buying one and selling the other, then any small difference between securities can be exploited with enough leverage. An unconstrained optimizer would go massively long the higher return one and massively short the lower, thereby multiplying random estimation errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact most of our currency example efficient frontier was highly leveraged and would be unattainable with the long only constraint; most of the \"results\" could be suspect. Thus, as we've already noted, in many cases holdings are constrained to be long only; this stops solutions from having any leverage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the problems with naively using past statistics to predict the future, past (sample) covariance matrices are often used to estimate expected covariances. In fact a great deal of effort has been spent on understanding how covariances change over time; we'll discuss these efforts in Chapters 9 and 10 below. But covariances are less variable than sample mean returns. So there are a number of estimation methods that start with sample covariance matrices and then try to modify them so they are better predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample covariance matrices are, by construction, at least positive semidefinite and possibly positive definite. We need $n$ time periods of observation to make an $n\\times n$ covariance matrix nonsingular, but even if we have that many periods we still might not have a rich set of data for each entry. There are $n+1\\choose 2$ different numbers in a covariance matrix. In every time period we observe $n$ rates of return. So if we have $t$ periods of observations, the number of observables per covariance is $\\frac{2t}{n+1}$. For example, for the Russell 1000&reg; index, we would need 5005 time periods if we wanted to have a not very impressive ten observations per covariance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5005 observations is about twenty years at a daily periodicity, which limits the number of companies that can be considered, as many do not have public trading data for that long. Too, daily observations are only valid for the most heavily traded stocks; a lightly traded stock may not have any meaningful trading activity after (say) 2PM, while more heavily traded stocks continue trading (and reacting to news) until 4PM. The day's return on the lightly traded stock is then asynchronous with the day's returns on more heavily traded stocks. That in turn can lead to misleadingly low correlations. Longer periodicities, like monthly, are often used to address this problem. A few hours of missing price movements out of a month is less noticeable than a few hours missing from a day. But at a monthly periodicity, any sample covariance matrix of the Russell 1000&reg; will be singular. That in turn causes problems with solving optimizations like \\eqref{eq:equal_frontier}, which will no longer have a unique solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when covariance matrices aren't singular, they can have problems. The _condition number_ of a matrix is the ratio of its largest eigenvalue to its smallest eigenvalue. The larger the condition number, the more likely it is that a very small change in input variables (means and covariances) can make a very large change in output variables (weights of the optimal solution). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the generally poor quality of covariance matrices, most users of optimizers put bounds on many quantities in addition to long-only (or not-too-short) constraints. Individual holdings usually have concentration limits &mdash; e.g. no single stock can occupy more than 5% of the portfolio. If the optimization is benchmark-relative, then constraints like \"every security must be within plus or minus 2% of the benchmark's weight in that security\" can be set. Constraints are often placed on other relevant characteristics like industries, countries, property types (in real estate portfolios), and duration/credit quality (in fixed income portfolios).\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting limits produces sensible portfolios, since the limits are set sensibly. But in effect it gives the answer to the optimizer &mdash; if the user is not careful, an optimizer can become a [smokescreen for the judgments of the human who put in very restrictive limits](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4479185)"

    "Practitioners often use methods intended to improve parameter estimates, sometimes in conjunction with proprietary views on the future direction of markets. Many such methods take the form of _shrinkage estimators_. The general idea is similar to Bayes's Rule: we have some kind of prior belief about a quantity we are trying to estimate, and we \"shrink\" the deviations from the prior in some way. Often the prior is _centralized_, meaning it is based on some kind of marketwide average value.\n",

    "Similarly, shrinkage estimators can be applied to the covariance matrix. In a 1978 paper, [Elton & Gruber](https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2326368) pointed out that there appeared to be little information in covariance matrices off the diagonal. They reluctantly concluded that just setting all off-diagonal correlations to the average value gave better estimates of future correlation matrices:\n",
    ">In this section, we will assume that all pairwise correlation coefficients are equal. While this probably does not represent the true pattern one finds in the economy, it is very difficult to obtain a better estimate. Elsewhere we have shown that this assumption produces better estimates of future correlation coefficients than do historical correlation coefficients...\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus &mdash; just as in the $1/N$ rule or the James-Stein and Jorion shrinkage estimators &mdash; Elton & Gruber came to the idea of a centralized prior. Olivier Ledoit and Michael Wolf used this idea in a [2003 paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.433840). Let $R=S^{-1}CS^{-1}$, where $C$ is a sample covariance matrix and $S=\\sqrt{diag(C)}$ is the matrix with sample standard deviations on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. $R$ is the sample correlation matrix. Let $\\rho_{average}=\\frac{u^{\\intercal}Ru-n}{n(n-1)}$ be the average off-diagonal correlation. Then the constant correlation covariance matrix is\n",
    "$$C_{\\rho}=S(I+\\rho_{average}(J-I))S\\tag{4.45}$$\n",
    "where as usual $J=uu^{\\intercal}$ is the matrix of all ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ledoit-Wolf constant-correlation covariance shrinkage estimator is\n",
    "$$C_{cc}=sC_{\\rho}+(1-s)C\\tag{4.46}$$\n",
    "where s is a scalar shrinkage parameter &mdash; the larger s is, the less trust you have in your correlations. Note that $C_{cc}$ has the same diagonal as the original $C$; variances are not changed in this shrinkage method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ledoit and Wolf give the following rather elaborate estimate of $s$:\n",
    "- First, define $y_{it}$ as the de-meaned observation of the $i^{th}$ security's return in time period $t$, so that $\\sum_t y_{it}=0$. Then if $Y$ is the sample de-meaned return matrix ($n\\times T$), then $C=\\frac{1}{T}YY^{\\intercal}$ is the sample covariance matrix.\n",
    "- Second, define $f_{ij}$ as the $(i,j)$ element of $C_{\\rho}$ and $s_{ij}$ as the (i,j) element of $C$.\n",
    "- Third, compute $\\hat{\\pi}=\\sum_i\\sum_k\\pi_{ij}$ where $\\pi_{ij}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^T\\bigl(y_{it}y_{jt}-s_{ij}\\bigr)^2$\n",
    "- Fourth, compute $\\hat{\\nu}_{ii,ij}=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^T\\bigl(y_{it}^2-s_{ii}\\bigr)\\bigl(y_{it}y_{jt}-s_{ij}\\bigr)$. Then compute $\\hat{x}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\pi_{ii}+\\frac{\\rho_{average}}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1,j\\neq i}^n\\bigl(\\sqrt{\\frac{s_{jj}}{s_{ii}}}\\hat{\\nu}_{ii,ij}+\\sqrt{\\frac{s_{ii}}{s_{jj}}}\\hat{\\nu}_{jj,ij}\\bigr)$\n",
    "- Fifth, compute $\\hat\\gamma=\\sum_{i=1}^n(f_{ij}-s_{ij})^2$\n",
    "- Sixth, set $s=\\frac{\\hat{\\pi}-\\hat{x}}{\\hat{\\gamma}}$. Ledoit and Wolf suggest bounding this between 0 and 1 if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this estimate of the optimal shrinkage intensity $s$ is quite complicated to write down, it is not hard to program. An easier heuristic is to set $s$ equal to the fraction of the trace contained in the correlation matrix's first $\\sqrt{n}$ eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a later paper [Ledoit and Wolf 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0047-259X(03)00096-4) suggest a different prior: rather than keeping variances the same, they shrink them back to the average variance. They also shrink correlations to zero. This second Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage method has [been implemented in packages like Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/covariance.html#shrunk-covariance).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage method starts with $X$, the $T\\times n$ matrix of data such as returns or log-returns of $n$ variables observed over $T$ time periods. The sample covariance matrix is $C=\\frac{1}{T-1}X'(I-J/T)X$, where $I$ is the $T\\times T$ identity matrix and $J$ is the $T\\times T$ matrix of all ones; the $I-J/T$ term de-means the observations. This is shrunk to\n",
    "$$C^*=s^*(\\bar{v}I)+(1-s^*)C\\label{eq:ledoit_wolf_2}\\tag{4.47}$$\n",
    "where $\\bar{v}$ is the average variance, i.e. the trace of the sample covariance matrix $C$ divided by $n$, the dimension of $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shrinkage intensity $s^*$ is formed as follows: Define $d=\\|S-\\bar{v}I\\|$, where $\\|x\\|=\\sqrt{\\text{tr}{(xx^{\\intercal})/n}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^nx_{i,j}^2}$.

    "$$\\bar{b}^2=\\frac{1}{T^2}\\sum_{i=1}^T\\|x_i^{\\intercal}x_i-C\\|^2\\tag{4.48}$$\n",
    "where $x_i$ is the $i^{th}$ row of the de-meaned observation matrix $(I-J/T)X$. Then the shrinkage intensity is $s^*=min(1,\\frac{\\bar{b}^2}{d^2})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A heuristic method combining the two Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage estimators with both variance and correlation priors centralized looks like this:\n",
    "$$C_{cc}^*=s_{cc}^*\\bar{v}(I+\\rho_{average}(J-I))+(1-s_{cc}^*)C\\label{eq:ledoit_wolf_heuristic}\\tag{4.49}$$\n",

    "In the next cell we apply the heuristic Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage method \\eqref{eq:ledoit_wolf_heuristic} to our three-currency example covariance matrix. As above, we hold out the last year of our sample data so we can later compare the estimates with the last year's out-of-sample covariance matrix. For comparison, we show the Scikit-Learn version of the \\eqref{eq:ledoit_wolf_2} estimator. Both methods have small shrinkage intensities due to the large number of observations, which increases confidence in the sample covariance matrix $C$."

    "### 4.2.2 Statistical Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The shrinkage estimators of the previous section seem plausible. Some of them have theoretical backing based on assumptions about underlying distributions &mdash; generally multivariate normal &mdash; or about asymptotic behavior. But since any theoretical assumptions about underlying distributions or asymptotic behavior are likely to be violated in practice, it's desirable to have a metric that tests the quality of an estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate metric is the degree to which using the estimator in a portfolio selection process improves out-of-sample results. But there are common statistical tests for equality of means, variances, and covariance matrices that can be used to check directly whether or not a method is delivering better out-of-sample prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically such tests are based on a function of observed data that produces a scalar metric whose distribution is known under assumptions about the distribution of the underlying data. It's also common that the test statistic will have a minimum (and best) value of zero. For example, suppose $f(x_1,x_2)$ is the statistic that we test to see whether or not the means of $x_1$ and $x_2$ could be the same, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are sets of observed $n$-vectors. We will probably have $f(x_1,x_2)=0$ when $\\bar{x_1}=\\bar{x_2}$. $f(x_1,x_2)$ will then increase as $\\bar{x_1}$ gets further and further away from $\\bar{x_2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a test metric like $f(x_1,x_2)$ is computed, a **`p-value`** can be found. The p-value is the cdf of the test metric under the test distribution. For example, we'll show a test statistic in \\eqref{eq:hotelling_stat} below that does what we described in the previous paragraph; it tests for equality of means. This statistic follows an F distribution (see below) if the underlying data is multivariate normal. Thus the larger the cdf of the test statistic, the less likely it is that the two samples were generated by processes with the same mean vector. If the cdf is large enough (typically .95 or .99 for 5% or 1% significance), we might say that we reject the null hypothesis. (In our example the null hypothesis is the equality of means of the generating processes for the two samples.) Otherwise we **`fail to reject the null hypothesis.`**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately p-values depend on what are usually overly strong assumptions about the underlying generating distributions of the observed data. We agree with the [American Statistical Association's statement](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108) on p-values, which among other things states\n",
    ">Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "But while the p-values might not be realistic, the test metrics might still help to distinguish relative distances. For example there might be two different methods of predicting out-of-sample behavior. We can look at the test metric that gives how distant each predictive vector is from out-of-sample data that was generated after the predictions were made. This can help assess predictive quality on a relative basis, but not necessarily on an absolute basis."

The distance metric was based on the inverse of the population covariance matrix $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more general form of this metric is [Hotelling's T statistic](https://doi.org/10.1214%2Faoms%2F1177732979), which in turn is a generalization of the Student's T statistic we will see in Section 7.2 below. Hotelling supposes that we have two groups of data drawn independently from multivariate normal distributions, and we want to test the hypothesis that the mean vectors are the same.\n",

    "#### 4.2.2.3 Equality of covariance matrices: Box's M Test\n",
    "\n",
    "[Box's M Test](https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/36.3-4.317) can be used to test the equality of covariance matrices. If $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_{comb}$ are as defined in Section 4.2.2.1, then Box's M statistic is\n",
    "$$M(1,2)=\\bigl((T_1+T_2-2)\\ln{(\\det(S_{comb}))}-(T_1-1)\\ln{(\\det(S_1))}$$\n",
    "$$-(T_2-1)\\ln{(\\det(S_2))}\\bigr)\\label{eq:box_m_stat}\\tag{4.52}$$\n",
    "The statistic is modified by a multiplier that takes into account finite sample size. Box defines (equation (49)):\n",
    "$$A_1=\\frac{2p^2+3p-1}{6(p+1)}\\bigl(\\frac{1}{T_1-1}+\\frac{1}{T_2-1}-\\frac{1}{T_1+T_2-2}\\bigr)\\label{eq:box_m_a1}\\tag{4.53}$$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$$A_2=\\frac{(p-1)(p+2)}{6}\\bigl(\\frac{1}{(T_1-1)^2}+\\frac{1}{(T_2-1)^2}-\\frac{1}{(T_1+T_2-2)^2}\\bigr)\\label{eq:box_m_a2}\\tag{4.54}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $A_2-A_1^2\\leq0$, $M(1,2)(1-A_1)$ is distributed as a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $\\text{df}_1$ degrees of freedom, where $\\text{df}_1=\\frac{p(p+1)}{2}$. So in this case, the p-value is $\\chi^2(M(1,2)(1-A_1),\\text{df}_1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, define $\\text{df}_2=\\frac{\\text{df}_1+2}{A_2-A_1^2}$ and $b=\\frac{\\text{df}_1}{1-A_1-(\\text{df}_1/\\text{df}_2)}$; then $M(1,2)/b$ is distributed as an F distribution with $\\text{df}_1$ and $\\text{df}_2$ degrees of freedom. In this case the p-value is $F(M(1,2)/b,\\text{df}_1,\\text{df}_2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is that that $S_1$ and $S_2$ were formed from samples drawn from multivariate normal distributions with a common covariance matrix. We reject the null hypothesis with confidence $c$ when the p-value is greater than or equal to $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This test is very sensitive to the assumption of multivariate normality. A useful heuristic is to first use Levene's Test on the diagonals of the covariance matrices. This provides more precise information as to the particular variables causing hetereoskedasticity, and is less sensitive to non-normality. Once the variances have been checked, the correlation matrices can be extracted from the covariance matrices and Box's M Test can be applied to the correlation matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the next segment applies Box's M Test in two parts: first to variances only, and then to correlation matrices. The latest year is compared to previous years' sample data as well as to the Ledoit-Wolf heuristic estimates."

    "### 4.2.3 Resampled Efficient Frontier\n",
    "\n",
    "Shrinkage techniques deal with estimation error in means and covariances, but not directly with finding the portfolios on the efficient frontier. In 1992, [Philippe Jorion](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4479507) addressed the problem of finding efficient frontiers directly with the following procedure:\n",
    ">1. Compute the means and covariance matrix from the actual sample of historical returns. Define T as the sample size (number of months, say) and N as the number of assets. Perform the optimization, given the stated objective function and investor constraints.\n",
    ">2. Assume that the estimates from Step 1 are true values. From a multivariate normal distribution with these parameters, draw one random sample of N joint returns. This represents one month of simulated returns. Sample again until T months are generated.\n",
    ">3. Estimate from these simulated returns a new set of means and a new variance-covariance matrix; perform an optimization using these inputs. The simulated optimal portfolio provides one observation in the distribution of the original optimal portfolio.\n",
    ">4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until the distribution of the optimal portfolio is approximated with enough precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can follow Jorion's procedure to see how much ambiguity there is in the minimum-variance portfolio $w_{minv}=\\frac{C^{-1}u}{u^{\\intercal}C^{-1}u}$ from our three-currency example:"

    "There's a very large range of mean returns of the resampled minimum variance portfolio shown in Figure 4.6. The standard deviations (x-axis) are less variable, but even they show not only a range, but also an inevitable upward bias. The red marker is the original minimum variance portfolio, which is the only efficient portfolio on the graph according to the original parameters. The blue marker is the average of the sample characteristics, which is riskier than the original minimum variance portfolio. The difference between the blue marker and the red marker is an indication of how overly optimistic we were about our ability to get a low-variance portfolio.\n",

    "Typically we see that zero is in (or close to) the confidence interval for the first (Swiss franc) weight, so we're not even sure we should have any in the minimum variance portfolio. The pound sterling (second) and Japanese yen (third) confidence intervals are typically about 8% wide. And the minimum variance portfolio is generally the most stable since it doesn't use the mean vector as an input!\n",
    "\n",
    "A _resampled efficient frontier_ takes this resampling process and averages it to get a collection of optimal mean-variance portfolios that, it is hoped, will have less dependence on sampling noise. One way of averaging was proposed by Richard Michaud[$^7$](#four_footnotes) in 1998; Michaud has a [US patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6003018A/en) on this method, which is offered commercially through the firm [New Frontier Advisors](https://www.newfrontieradvisors.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Michaud aggregates the minimum variance portfolios from each sample as we did above. He then chops the remainder of the efficient frontier from the minimum variance to the maximum return &mdash; assuming there is a maximum return &mdash; into an equal number of steps. For example suppose the original frontier had a minimum return of .2 and a maximum of 2 and there were 10 steps desired along the frontier; then 10 efficient portfolios $P_{1,0}$ with return .2; $P_{2,0}$ with return .4; ...; and $P_{10,0}$ with return 2 would be recorded. Then a resampled frontier would be generated for simulation 1; say its minimum and maximum returns were .15 and 2.88. The compositions of the 10 portfolios $P_{1,1}$ with return .15; $P_{2,1}$ with return .47; ...; and $P_{10,1}$ with return 2.88 would be recorded. This would be done for S simulations. Then the resampled frontier would consist of the 10 portfolios $\\frac{1}{S+1}\\sum_{s=0}^S P_{i,s}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The Michaud method essentially aggregates resampled portfolios by target mean. Another method is offered by [Morningstar/Ibbotson](https://corporate.morningstar.com/Fib/documents/MethodologyDocuments/ResearchPapers/RobustAssetAllocation.pdf) which essentially aggregates by target standard deviation; their description is:\n",
    ">Ibbotson uses a proprietary \"bin approach,\" in which asset allocations from the _simulated_ portfolios are grouped together based on narrowly defined standard deviation ranges that cover the risk spectrum. The average asset allocations are then linked back to the original inputs to plot the resampled efficient frontier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whichever method is used, the general idea is to (a) lower and (b) estimate sampling noise through a process of resampling. [Bernd Scherer](https://doi.org/10.2469/faj.v58.n6.2489) points out that resampling methods will average out to the original efficient frontier when there are no constraints in the optimization process, but when there are constraints - for example, long-only holdings - the resampled frontier will generally improve on the original frontier. That is, empirical tests have generally shown that resampled frontiers do better at predicting out-of-sample (future) behavior than the original efficient frontier. But resampling is a heuristic rather than a proof, and practitioners continue to search for even better heuristics to predict out-of-sample behavior.\n"

Robert Litterman headed quantitative management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management and who we have already seen in the Litterman-Sheinkman paper about [key rates](#rolldown_key_rates). \n",

    "In the Black-Litterman framework, we assume there is a true but unobservable expected mean $n$-vector $\\mu$ that is associated with the process generating asset returns. Before updating our information to estimate $\\mu$, we have a prior belief: namely that it is consistent with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (\"CAPM\"), which we will cover in Section 6.1. The prior that comes from that model is:\n",
    "$$\\mu_{CAPM}=r_f u + (\\mathbb{E}[r_M]-r_f)\\beta\\label{eq:black_litterman_capm}\\tag{4.70}$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbb{E}[r_M]$ is the expected return on the market. $\\beta=\\frac{w_M^{\\intercal}C}{w_M^{\\intercal}C w_M}$, where $C$ is as in \\eqref{eq:covariance_matrix}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our error of estimate is given by a multivariate normal distribution with mean 0 and covariance matrix $sC$, where $s$ is a confidence scalar. If s=0, we are perfectly confident that $\\mu_{CAPM}$ is the right answer. As s gets larger, we get less confident. $C$ might be estimated from historical returns or from an equity model. Note however that a full covariance matrix $C$ is not consistent with the CAPM, which assumes $C=\\sigma_M\\beta^{\\intercal}\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Black-Litterman framework, we can express views (opinions) about the actual mean return n-vector $\\mu$. A view is a value of some linear combination of returns. The simplest view is that a return on a particular asset will take on a particular value, but we can also (for example) express a view on an industry (a weighted combination of the assets in that industry), or on one group of assets versus another (a hedge or relative value trade). In general, we write\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, if we believe pharmaceutical stocks will outperform energy stocks by 12%, a row of $V$ would have positive weights (perhaps capitalization-weighted) on all the pharmaceutical stocks and negative weights on energy stocks, and the corresponding row of the v-column-vector $p$ would be 12%.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to minimize the error term $\\epsilon$ on the right-hand side. To do this, we could solve a standard ordinary least squares (OLS) regression using least squares, obtaining $\\mu=(V^{\\intercal}V)^{-1}V^{\\intercal}p$. However in accordance with our theme of keeping track of how much we don't trust our parameters, we assume that the error vector $\\epsilon$ is multivariate normally distributed with mean 0 and $v\\times v$ covariance matrix $\\Gamma$. The smaller the entries of $\\Gamma$, the more confident we are in our views. Usually we assume off-diagonal elements are 0, and that really is just to make things easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have an error matrix like $\\Gamma$, we can use an extension of ordinary least squares regression called generalized least squares (GLS). The idea is to modify OLS regression by weighting the variables we are more sure about more heavily, and the variables we are less sure about less heavily. The GLS solution is\n",

Is there some relationship between the Swiss, British, and Japanese economies that is being revealed, or is it just a statistical artifact? Pursuing these kinds of questions can lead to better results.\n",
